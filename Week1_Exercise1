Step 1: Grabbing distinct cities. 
Step 2: All customers that are eligible. Making sure the join criteria makes sense. 
Step 3: Join eligible customers with their geo location from the distinct cities.  
Step 4: Grabbing the supplier information and geo from the distinct cities. 
Step 5: Calculating the distance with the st_distance function. Cross Joining to grab the distance for each supplier to customer. 
Step 6: Filtering out only the closests suppliers to the customer using QUALIFY.
